            What is it? A used lawn-mower? Does Socialism Has Worked??? Did it apply for a job? Is it an ever-going process based on scientific theories just like capitalism?
            YES. To all of these. Socialism automatically applies everyone to every job. Also there is no more homelessness OR illiteracy. Also! IT IS a used lawn-mower!
            It is Constructivism VS. Consumerism. School is primarily shop class! You learn how to fix anything you want because the workers own all of the shit!
            ALL of the shit! So you can freely get the tools and replacement parts and gas/oil to get that lawn-mower working again. Although, I would simply turn that 
            lawn-mower into a go-kart, because that's what Constructivism and Communism are all about: working with your hands to build up what the community wants and needs; yourself and together.
