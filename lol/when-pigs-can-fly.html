            (Meaning, when the protectorates of justice are allowed to behave like the children in Lord of the Flies)
            A plane full ‘o cops crash lands on an abandoned island. Obviously, they assume law and order but over time their strict ideology clashes with material needs.
            3 of the police officers are undercover gay, one is trans. One of the officers only joined to leak information regarding an ongoing investigation into police brutality when a couple dozen of the higher-ranking officers is brutally murdered.
            This obviously degrades into a cannibalistic death cult, made worse upon the discovery of a Metallica CD and a portable speaker in the wreckage of the landlocked plane.
            Outvoted 14-88, the decision is made to rearrange the luggage spelling out “HELP US” into a giant swastika. 
            A violent brawl begins when one of the smarter officers recommends to the head of the death cult that they might have arranged the swastika the wrong way, and someone may actually interpret it as a symbol of peace depending on where they are.
            At this point it is revealed that they are off the coast of Malaysia, as several members of the police have been contacting their missionary friends in Cambodia and Taiwan.
            The closeted trans police officer manages to escape in a boat to Thailand, where they are summarily executed by King Rama X for being an American spy.
            Anyway, it ends with the PRC finally sending help & rescue crews, and they get our boys home safe.
